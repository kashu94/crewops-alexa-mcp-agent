## Model Context Protocol and the MCP Python SDK

**Used for.** CrewOps is an MCP server (spec 2025-11-25, Streamable HTTP, `mcp` 1.30 with
FastMCP) with 30 tools: asking questions in plain words, the controller's queue,
disruptions, reporting, the four-eyes plan actions, the operations overview, admin tools,
and the deterministic crew-operations tools behind `crew_tool`. Each call runs as the
person signed in, with their role's rights.

**What worked well.** The protocol itself is clean and was quick to adopt: tool
annotations (read-only, destructive) map directly onto "ask before you commit", and
stateless Streamable HTTP fits a serverless runtime. The Python SDK's FastMCP gets a
server running in minutes; the client side (`ClientSession`, `streamable_http_client`)
made an end-to-end test harness and a command-line client straightforward.

**What needs work.**
- Plain-function tools run on the event loop, so one slow call blocks every other
  request, with no warning (FL-005).
- DNS-rebinding protection switches on silently from the bind address and answers 421 with
  no hint which hosts are allowed (FL-006).
- A session manager can run only once, which makes per-test servers awkward (FL-007).
- A tool returning `dict` arrives as escaped JSON text, not structured content, depending
  on the return annotation (FL-011).

**Onboarding.** Fast: from the getting-started guide to a working local server in well
under an hour; the hours went into the behaviours above, which the docs do not mention.

**Build again?** Yes. One server now serves our web app, our Alexa skill, Claude and any
other MCP host, through one set of role checks.

## Agent Skills

**Used for.** `skills/crewops-crew-control`: teaches any agent with the server connected
to work crew control like a controller (ground rules, playbooks per role, voice phrasing,
error recovery), with a tool reference generated from the server.

**What worked well.** The format is simple (a `SKILL.md` with two required fields, and
optional references, scripts and assets), and progressive disclosure keeps the agent's
context small: the details load only when needed.

**What needs work.** It is not yet clear from the Alexa+ pages how an Agent Skill reaches
Alexa+ itself, as opposed to a coding agent; an Alexa+-specific example would help.

**Onboarding.** Under an hour from the specification to a validated skill.

**Build again?** Yes: it is the cheapest way to make an MCP server usable well by agents
we do not control.

## Alexa Skills Kit (custom skill, account linking, Proactive Events, Skill Messaging, Reminders, ASK CLI and SMAPI)

**Used for.** A CrewOps skill: "what's waiting", any crew-control question by voice, and,
when a disruption reaches a controller's desk, a notification (chime and yellow ring)
followed by the alert spoken through a reminder. Linked to the app's Cognito sign-in;
hosted on a Lambda function URL that verifies every request's signature and certificate.

**What worked well.** Account linking with an OAuth authorization-code server worked first
time once configured. Request signing is well specified, so verifying it ourselves (needed
for a function URL) was straightforward. SMAPI (`simulate-skill`, `update-skill-manifest`,
`set-interaction-model`, `get-skill-status`) is reliable and scriptable, and was faster
than the console for every step.

**What needs work.**
- A skill cannot make an Echo speak an alert unprompted: notifications only chime, and
  speaking one takes Skill Messaging plus a reminder, three APIs for one sentence; the
  Reminders reference does not say whether a Skill Messaging request counts as in session
  (FL-201).
- The Proactive Events reference lists endpoints with no mapping to countries; India is on
  the Europe endpoint, found on another page (FL-202).
- Alexa cannot trigger Lambda in Sydney, so the skill needed a function URL and its own
  request verification.
- The new console has no Alexa Notifications permission switch; it took the ASK CLI and the
  manifest (FL-217).
- The ASK CLI sign-in demanded an email the phone-only developer account did not have, and
  the console's sign-in error only said "There was a problem" (FL-218).
- The console's simulator spun on a request the skill never received, while
  `simulate-skill` worked at once (FL-219).
- Account linking needs Alexa's redirect URLs before the authorization server exists, but
  the page will not save without that server's details (FL-220).

**Onboarding.** Slower than the AWS side: about half a day from a new skill to a linked,
answering skill, mostly in the console and sign-in issues above.

**Build again?** Yes, with reservations: voice is the right interface for a controller
with their hands full, but proactive voice alerts need a simpler, supported path.

## Alexa+ (MCP add-ons)

**Used for.** Evaluated as the way to bring the CrewOps MCP server into Alexa+ directly.

**What worked well.** The direction (bring your own MCP server, discovered as tools) is
exactly what a business agent needs.

**What needs work.** The integration is in Preview, needs OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and a
protected-resource metadata document rather than an authorizer-protected server, asks for
round trips under 500 ms, which a question answered with a model call does not meet, and
Alexa+ is not offered in India, where we build and test (FL-203).

**Build again?** Yes, once it is generally available: the server is ready for it.

## Amazon Bedrock (Nova 2 Lite, Titan Text Embeddings V2, Guardrails, Converse)

**Used for.** Nova 2 Lite triages questions the rules cannot route, drafts answers through
a tool loop, and rewords template answers for speech; every draft is verified against the
tool results before it is used. Titan V2 embeddings (512 dimensions) feed hybrid search.
Guardrails screen every question and answer, including prompt-attack filtering.

**What worked well.** The Converse API made the tool loop simple and model-agnostic; Nova
2 Lite accepted our strict JSON-schema tool definitions; the guardrail's prompt-attack
filter needed no tuning; latency through the global inference profile was good.

**What needs work.**
- Model ids that look right cannot be invoked from some regions without the right
  inference profile, and the per-region rules are not next to the ids (FL-020).
- Reworded answers sometimes add a number no tool returned; a grounded-rewrite option
  would help (FL-009).
- The model filled in a missing detail instead of asking (FL-012).
- A guardrail change never published a new version through CloudFormation, and replacing a
  version deleted the one the running app used (FL-021, FL-022).

**Onboarding.** Quick for the first call; about an hour on model ids and regions.

**Build again?** Yes. The verifier pattern (model drafts, engine facts) makes Nova safe to
use for a domain where a wrong number is a safety issue.

## Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (Runtime, Memory, JWT authorizer)

**Used for.** Hosting the MCP server (ARM64 code package, Streamable HTTP) behind a JWT
authorizer that accepts the app's Cognito access tokens, so every tool call arrives as the
signed-in person; Memory keeps each conversation's last turns for follow-up questions.

**What worked well.** The JWT authorizer removed a whole layer of auth code: tokens are
checked before the server sees a request. Deploying a code package (no container) from CDK
kept the build simple.

**What needs work.** Memory's `blob` payload is described as binary but is a JSON
document, and the read-back order is undocumented (FL-013). A Windows-built zip can lack
the Linux file permissions the runtime expects (documented in our README).

**Onboarding.** Half a day, most of it in the code-package format and authorizer settings.

**Build again?** Yes: it is the easiest way we found to host an authenticated MCP server.

## Amazon DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams

**Used for.** One table for the whole operation (about 5,000 items through 31 December:
crew, flights, trips, certificates, duty clocks, reserves) plus disruptions, plans, audit
events, links and security events. Transactions make every plan action atomic and
conditioned on the state it expects; streams trigger analysis and notifications.

**What worked well.** Conditional transactions gave us four-eyes and conflict safety
without locks; streams with filter criteria made the event-driven design natural.

**What needs work.** The boto3 table resource silently re-serialises transaction items
(FL-004); a third stream reader risks throttling with no warning from CDK (FL-204); IAM is
not enforced by local mocks, so a missing grant passed every test and failed in AWS
(FL-191).

**Build again?** Yes.

## Amazon S3 Vectors

**Used for.** Hybrid (keyword plus semantic) search over the legality rules, example
questions and past scenarios.

**What worked well.** No cluster to run and pay for: an index is cheap and immediately
queryable, which suits a project that is idle most of the time.

**What needs work.** The local mock library sends unimplemented S3 Vectors calls to real
AWS instead of failing (FL-030).

**Build again?** Yes, for any small-to-medium semantic index.

## AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon EventBridge Scheduler, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

**Used for.** SQS plus a worker Lambda ingests reports exactly once; Lambdas analyse
disruptions, notify (console, email, Alexa, desktop alerts) and escalate; SNS carries
admin-managed email alerts filtered by role; one-time EventBridge schedules check whether
a disruption was left untouched; Parameter Store holds the Alexa credentials and push keys.

**What worked well.** One-time schedules that delete themselves are a perfect fit for
"check again in 10 minutes", with no timer running while nothing happens. SNS filter
policies made per-role alerts trivial.

**What needs work.** The Lambda Python runtime has no cryptography library (FL-213); a
function's logs can live outside `/aws/lambda/<name>` with no hint from the CLI (FL-195);
one SNS email endpoint holds only one subscription per topic, and pending subscriptions
are awkward to cancel (FL-027, FL-028); a second SQS queue policy silently replaces the
first (FL-008).

**Build again?** Yes.

## Amazon Cognito

**Used for.** Sign-in for every role (one group per role), the Alexa account-linking
client, and the desk speaker's device account.

**What worked well.** Groups in the access token made role checks simple and verifiable
everywhere (the MCP server, the Alexa skill, the web app).

**What needs work.** CDK's default app client turns OAuth on with a placeholder callback
(FL-023); an empty write-attributes list means "all attributes" (FL-024); pool names are
not unique (FL-025); a password the policy refuses left users stuck mid-creation (FL-026).

**Build again?** Yes, with care: the defaults are more permissive than they look.

## AWS AppSync Events

**Used for.** Pushing every disruption status change to open consoles over WebSocket,
publish by IAM only, subscribe by Cognito sign-in with a role check in the handler.

**What worked well.** A managed pub/sub with no connection management on our side.

**What needs work.** The handler docs do not show what `ctx.identity` holds (FL-014), and
the WebSocket docs say "ID token" while the example is an access token (FL-116).

**Build again?** Yes.

## Amazon Polly

**Used for.** Speaking answers in the web assistant and the desk speaker's announcements
(neural Indian-English voice).

**What worked well.** Fast, natural, and simple to call from the web server.

**What needs work.** Nothing significant.

**Build again?** Yes.

## AWS CDK (Python)

**Used for.** Every resource, in nine stacks, with synth tests asserting least-privilege
IAM, encryption and filters.

**What worked well.** Synth tests caught several configuration mistakes before deployment;
grants and constructs keep IAM tight.

**What needs work.** `cdk deploy` waits forever on a dropped connection with no output
(FL-002); `npx aws-cdk@2` can silently run an old global CLI (FL-003); `--app is required`
does not say which folder was searched (FL-194); every Python process loading CDK prints a
Node end-of-life banner (FL-010); convenience grants include more than their names suggest
(FL-029). On a new AWS project account, a service-control policy denied CDK outside the
home region with no hint why (FL-001).

**Build again?** Yes.

## AWS Builder mini-challenge: how AWS is used

Bedrock (Nova 2 Lite through the Converse API, Titan V2 embeddings, Guardrails) for the
question pipeline, always verified against a deterministic legality engine; AgentCore
Runtime hosting the MCP server behind a Cognito JWT authorizer, and AgentCore Memory for
follow-ups; DynamoDB with transactions and streams as the single source of truth; S3
Vectors for hybrid search; SQS and Lambda for exactly-once report ingestion and
stream-driven analysis; SNS, AppSync Events, EventBridge Scheduler and Parameter Store for
alerts, live updates, escalation and secrets; Cognito for every sign-in; Polly for voice;
everything defined in AWS CDK with synth tests. Integrations are documented in the README
(AWS services, Deploying) and ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Feature requests

| Request | Why it matters to CrewOps | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| An opt-in "announce" event, or a notification whose spoken text the skill supplies | A controller must hear what happened the moment it lands, hands-free; today it takes three APIs | Critical |
| Alexa+ MCP add-ons: a latency limit per tool type, and acceptance of an authorizer-protected server | Deterministic lookups answer in milliseconds; a question that needs a model cannot meet 500 ms | Important |
| Alexa+ availability (or developer testing) in India | We cannot test an Alexa+ integration where we build | Important |
| The Alexa Notifications permission and event publications back in the console | Today they need the ASK CLI and a manifest upload | Important |
| A country-to-endpoint table on the Proactive Events reference | Sending to the wrong region fails silently for that account | Nice-to-have |
| A grounded-rewrite option in the Converse API | Lets a model reword verified answers without adding numbers | Important |
| Run sync tools off the event loop by default in FastMCP | One slow tool blocks every other request today | Important |
| A managed Lambda layer (or KMS operation) for web push cryptography | Desktop alerts need the cryptography library, absent from the runtime | Nice-to-have |
