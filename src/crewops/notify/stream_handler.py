"""Lambda handler for disruption status changes on the table's stream.

The event source mapping already filters to disruption items. Here we keep the records
whose status actually changed and publish each to the console channel. Changes that need
someone also go out as a role alert, and an analysed disruption alerts every team it names.

Console updates are best effort. If one fails the console catches up on its next read. A
failed alert is reported as a batch item failure so Lambda retries from that record. That
can send a console event twice, which is harmless since it only makes the console re-read,
and an alert that went out before the failure may also be sent twice.
