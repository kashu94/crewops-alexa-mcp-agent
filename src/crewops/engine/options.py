"""Who could cover this seat, what each choice costs, and why everyone else is out.

``find_options`` assesses every crew member of the needed rank against the pairing and
returns the legal ones ranked by cost, with cancellation always last as the baseline. Any
figure a controller might want read out (next-tier premium, how many times cheaper covering
is than cancelling, how many options tie) is computed here so a model never has to.

Ranked by cost, then departure delay, then crew id so the order is stable. Seniority and
travel allowances are in the cost, so they only affect rank through what they pay. The risk
score is shown but never changes the rank.
