"""Submit, withdraw, reject and approve plans. The rules live here, in code.

None of this is exposed as a model tool; the advisor and the analysis only prepare options,
and every call takes a signed-in ``Caller``.

The rules, roughly:

- A disruption belongs to the desk it was assigned when analysed (for older records, the
  desks of the aircraft it touches). Only that desk's controller can plan it.
- A seat is a pairing, a role and the crew member being replaced. Seats with no legal cover,
  or that have already started, go in the plan as uncovered and the controller has to
  acknowledge them to submit. If nothing at all is coverable, the disruption is closed with
  a reason instead.
- Cancelling one seat cancels the whole trip. Every seat of that trip in the plan has to be
  cancelled too, the cost is counted once, and the commit releases the whole crew so no
  aircraft is left with one pilot.
- Flying one cabin crew short is checked across the whole plan, counting anyone on the trip
  already reported unavailable, at submit time and again at approval.
- Four eyes: the approver can't be the submitter. Only the submitter can withdraw.
- Each choice has to be legal at submit and is checked again against the roster at
  approval. If anything changed the plan goes STALE and nothing is written.
- Approval is the commit. Roster changes, plan, disruption and audit are one transaction,
  conditioned on each pairing's crew and each moved person's roster version matching what
  the re-check saw, so two approvals (or an approval and a sick report) on the same person
  can't both land.
- If another open plan, or another disruption's proposed cover, wants the same person on
  overlapping dates, the submitter gets a warning and the approver sees it in their queue.
