"""A circuit breaker in front of Bedrock: stop waiting on a model service that is down.

Every model call already has a firm timeout and a deterministic fallback, so a failure
never costs an answer. But while Bedrock is failing (a regional outage, throttling, a
network drop), each question would still wait out its timeout first, up to ten seconds
or more, when a voice answer has eight. So after ``threshold`` failures in a row the
breaker opens: model calls fail at once for ``cooldown`` seconds and every answer comes
straight from the roster in DynamoDB through the templates. Then one call is let through
(half open): success closes the breaker, failure opens it again.

Only an unavailable service counts: timeouts, lost connections, throttling and 5xx
errors. A request the service refuses as invalid is our fault, not an outage, and passes
through without tripping anything.

One breaker serves the whole process (``MODEL_BREAKER``), so it remembers across the
periodic rebuilds of the pipeline.
